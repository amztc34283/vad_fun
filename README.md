# Multilingual Turn Completion Detection

## Objective
Build a language-agnostic system that can accurately detect when a speaker has completed their turn, distinguishing between natural pauses and actual turn completions across multiple languages.

## Base Requirements
1. System must:
   - Process real-time audio streams
   - Detect turn completions with lower latency than basic VAD
   - Work across provided languages without language-specific rules
   - Handle natural pauses without premature cutoff

2. Implementation must include:
   - Feature extraction pipeline
   - Turn completion detection algorithm
   - Performance metrics and analysis
   - Documentation of approach

3. Analysis of:
   - False positive/negative rates
   - Latency measurements
   - Cross-language performance comparison
   - Failure cases and potential improvements

## Stretch Goals
- Handle code-switching scenarios
- Adaptive threshold learning
- Real-time performance optimization
- Additional language support

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code quality and organization
- Algorithm design and justification
- Performance across languages
- Analysis depth and insights
- Documentation clarity
